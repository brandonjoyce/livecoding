# LiveCoding.tv Stream Planning

Looking for ideas to stream on livecoding.tv.
Documenting questions, ideas, and plans for streaming on livecoding.tv.
Taking feedback from the audience as I'm taking these notes.

## Goals
- Learn new things
- Teach new things
- Get actual work done (bonus)

## Planned Schedule
Mon, Wed, Fri (10pm-11pm Eastern)

## TODO
- Look into better Mic (A/V in general)
    - Maybe a boom mic would work better
    - Is the video from my mac webcam good enough?
- Internet speed, see if I can upgrade

## Ideas
- Current Events (new tech, new tools, important news in the programming field)
- Music?
    - Yes? - where to get it, what to play, should I take requests.
    - No?
- Call Ins?  Take calls from other devs and maybe pair program on things, or offer mentorship.
- Particular language interests?  Elixir has been top of my mind.
- Tools for Streaming
  - What's existing that I should use?
  - What could we possibly build on-stream?
  - Jukebox app (taking requests)
  - Automating scheduling, posting to social media
